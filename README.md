GeometricShapes-Smalltalk

This Smalltalk program, created as a team project with two other members, defines a hierarchy of classes to represent geometric shapes, including polygons, squares, and regular hexagons, as well as circles. 
It allows for the initialization of these shapes, calculation of their areas, centering them in the coordinate system, and creating inscribed circles. 
The program also includes methods for printing the properties of the shapes, such as their vertices, area, and circle details.
